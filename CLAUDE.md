## Development Workflow

### Recommended Development Workflow

1. **Local Development Setup**
   - Set up proper IDE/editor with relevant extensions
   - Configure linting and formatting tools
   - Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality

2. **Version Control**
   - Use feature branches for new development
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Create pull requests for code review
   - Maintain a clean git history

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Write unit tests for business logic
   - Implement integration tests for APIs
   - Add end-to-end tests for critical flows
   - Maintain >80% code coverage

4. **Deployment Process**
   - Use CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
   - Implement proper environment management
   - Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
   - Monitor application performance post-deployment




## Architecture Overview

## Architecture Recommendations

### System Design
- Implement a layered architecture
- Separate concerns between layers
- Use dependency injection for flexibility

### Data Flow
- Implement unidirectional data flow where possible
- Use appropriate state management patterns
- Cache frequently accessed data



## Development Guidelines

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Follow a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Group related functionality into cohesive modules
- Keep files focused and reasonably sized

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, meaningful names for variables and functions
- Follow language-specific naming conventions
- Be consistent throughout the codebase

### Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging



## Testing Strategy

## Unit Testing
- Test individual functions and components
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use mocking for external dependencies

## Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints
- Verify database operations
- Test third-party integrations

## E2E Testing
- Test critical user flows
- Verify cross-browser compatibility
- Test on multiple devices


## Deployment Instructions

## Prerequisites
- [List required tools/accounts]

## Environment Variables
```

```

## Deployment Steps
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

## Post-Deployment Checks
- Verify health endpoints
- Check logs for errors
- Run smoke tests


## AI Agent Instructions

## AI Agent Instructions

### General Guidelines
- Always read existing code before making changes
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation when changing behavior

### Code Quality
- Ensure code passes linting
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Consider performance implications
- Handle edge cases appropriately
